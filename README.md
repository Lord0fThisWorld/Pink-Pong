# PaddleHit
This is my first project - a console game. I intended to create something that will let me practice what I learned.
## Playability
It's really low. High playability was never expected here.

## Is it ready?
Most important features are already implemented, but it's still under development.

## Limitations
The game contains couple of 'em. For example console window size shouldn't be allowed to change manualy. Also console window onscreen position is not controlled so it may not be displayed as I intended to, and more... I hope I'll find a way to fix all these issues.

## About the project
Originally I was just following a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4M6WMscrw) on how to make a simple console pong game, but later I decided to change it completely and add a lot of functionality: settings and the whole menu, ball movement (now it's running on timespan instead of putting a thread to sleep which allows to use paddles with lesser lag).
